changed currentneighborList to currentNeighborList
changed type of currentNeighborList from HashSet to HashSet<Integer>, same for newNeighborList
Changed syntaxes accordingly
change sequenceNumbers to from HashMap<String, String> to <Integer, Integer>
Added all Generic types

Seems like error in the receivePing method:
if the packet is not for this node, should not send ping reply
Added if send to own code, send to the source instead of broadcast a ping reply

Implement send function to recognize directed ping, using routing table from Dijkstra's algorithm
