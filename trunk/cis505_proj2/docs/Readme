Server database:
HashMap<String (domainName), HashSet<String (userName)>> domainMap // domain vs users
HashMap<String (username@domain), HashSet<Email (including byte[], timestamp)>> userEmail
private HashMap <String, String> userPass = new HashMap <String, String> (); // user@domain, password

Template for SMTP client:
http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1996/jw-12-sockets.html?page=4

SMTP client and Pop3Client are from the web as a template. Remember to significantly modify them before using.

Todo:
Multi-threading for pop3 server: in case if the user closes socket without "QUIT".


===========special cases to test=================
Pop3:
1.	To indicate the end of stream, begin a line with a single '.' followed by a "CRLF" pair.
	However, if you want to send a line like this in your mail content, the Pop3 server should
	pre-pend a '.' at the beginning of the ".CRLF" and the client should strip the first '.' away
	when seeing it and not treat this line as terminating signal
2. Bug:
	In Pop3.java -> commandTop method, line 348, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when feeding "top 1"
	without the third argument. The method assumes user feeding 2 arguments. This should be checked
	instead of assumed. Similar cases are true for other commands.
	The interpretation of the commands falls on the server side since only the server knows what
	the implemented rules are.
	Suggestion: check the length of the arguments each time before parsing it on the server side.
