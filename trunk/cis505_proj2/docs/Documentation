We created an Integrated_Server that contains an SMTP_Server, an Pop3_Server, and an Cluster_Internal_Listening_Server, each of which are threads that listens to respective ports.
The Client contains an Pop3Client and an SMTP_Client, which handles mail retrieving and sending, respectively.
When a server is started, it first asks the registry server for a list of the servers of the same cluster. It then asks each server until find some one to send it the complete data set.
If no cluster server is available, it tries to read from the persistent data. If that is not available, it creates the data from scratch.
