Folder:
Every server has a folder, named cluster_name@cluster_port/username@domian/timestamp+hashcode (file name)

Relay email:
a client will create a thread for each server that returned from registry server, disconnect if nothing returned in 1 sec.

When replicate:
The timestamp is added into the email header, which is returned from the sequencer. And the receiver multicast, but not 
the sequencer.

Sequencer selection:
Whenever a new server comes up, it registers it with the registry server. Then it asks the server for all the servers.
Select all the servers belong to our cluster and send each of them a message to initiate a selection and find out
which ones are alive. Select the one with the max of "ip+port" from alive servers as the sequencer. 

If Sequencer dies£º
If sequencer does not reply, initiate a new election.
