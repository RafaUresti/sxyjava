The player starts out in the kitchen. The gold is located in the following rooms: Study, Bathroom, and the Treasure Room. However, in order to access the gold in the treasure room, the player must get the key. 

The key is inside the water barrel. In order to access the key, the player must use the hammer on the barrel. This means that the Player has to "LOOK" at the barrel, choose the hammer from the player inventory and use it.

In order to use the key to open up the locked room, the player must try to go in that direction (press South button >> direction buttons are disabled only if the door does not exist) first. The results pane will display that the room is locked. Only then, can the player use the key to unlock the door. 

Again, the game is over when the 3 pieces of gold are in the player's inventory.
